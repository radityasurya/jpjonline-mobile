Find Parking Space\n- Space must be 1.5 times your car length\n- Ensure no obstacles\n- Check parking signs\n\n#### 2. Initial Position\n- Stop car parallel to front car\n- Side distance: 60-90 cm\n- Side mirror aligned with front car's mirror\n\n#### 3. Start Reversing\n- Turn steering wheel full right\n- Reverse slowly\n- Monitor rear mirror\n\n#### 4. Correct Position\n- When car is at 45Â° angle, straighten steering\n- Continue reversing\n- Turn steering left to enter space\n\n#### 5. Final Position\n- Car parallel to other vehicles\n- Equal distance front and back\n- Distance from curb: 15-30 cm\n\n## Important Tips\n- Practice in safe areas first\n- Use cones or markers for practice\n- Don't rush\n- Use all mirrors properly",

      "content": "# Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)\n\n## What is ABS?\nAnti-lock Braking System (ABS) is a safety system that prevents wheels from locking during emergency braking.\n\n### How ABS Works\n\n#### Main Components\n1. **Wheel Speed Sensors**\n   - Monitor speed of each wheel\n   - Detect when wheels start to lock\n\n2. **Electronic Control Unit (ECU)**\n   - Process data from sensors\n   - Control brake pressure\n\n3. **Hydraulic Pump**\n   - Control brake fluid pressure\n   - Allow brake release and application\n\n#### Working Process\n1. Driver presses brake pedal\n2. Sensors detect wheels starting to lock\n3. ECU reduces brake pressure\n4. Wheels start rotating again\n5. Process repeats 15-20 times per second\n\n## ABS Advantages\n- Maintain steering control\n- Reduce braking distance\n- Prevent car skidding\n- Increase safety\n\n## How to Use ABS\n- Press brake pedal firmly\n- Don't release even if you feel vibration\n- Steer in desired direction\n- Let the system work\n\n## Maintenance\n- Check ABS warning light\n- Service according to schedule\n- Replace with quality brake fluid",
